In this recent year of technology, electronic devices and appliances have become very popular, particularly with the rapid growth of smartphones. The design of a home automation system consistent with local housing and good features for home automation through Bluetooth access is provided in this article. Design and deployment of the Bluetooth based home automation framework using android and Arduino. A component of smart home technology that uses Bluetooth on a mobile device is used in this research work, so it would be inexpensive and effective to use.
This paper describes a home automation system that is used to control home appliances using a smartphone application with Bluetooth wireless technology. Three key components were included in the system an Arduino, an appliance link microcontroller, a Bluetooth signal transmission module, and a smartphone with an android app to monitor home appliances. Bluetooth connectivity technologies and controlled device are that the operating range is low, but it can be controlled from anywhere within the home. We can monitor household appliances by using smartphone apps and provide protection to decrepit people. The concept of paper is to control home appliances and escape the dangerous electrical shock and comfort of people who are decrepit and mentally impaired, who can conveniently access and control home appliances by living in a single area and accessing them remotely without other peopleâ€™s help. Our home automation works smartly by offering improved quality of life and user convenience through the use of this device.
